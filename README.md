This code allows configurations to be injected directly into stormshield boxes.
the config file i tested and in the folder it is called "strom.cli"

There are 2 variables to respect {GETIPFUTURE} And {GETGW}

{GETGW} = Represents the gateway object for the stormshield.
{GETIPFUTURE} = Represents the future IP of the stormshield.

This software is useful for being able to inject configurations directly on stormshields
When they are in IP address 10.0.0.254.
